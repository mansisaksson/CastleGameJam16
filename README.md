# Our entry for the 2016 Castle Game Jam

Go on a spooky journey through the Swedish forest landscapes on your trusty steam locomotive. But beware, there has been talks of wolves attacking trains.

Quite happy with how this turned out. The combination of VR and scary wolves is quite effective, I would not recommend this game for the easily scared.

A built verson of the game can be found under the Releases tab (Requires a VR headset to play)
